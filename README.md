# Configurations

This branch contains additional Marlin firmware configurations for LulzBot TAZ
3D printers. Each printer and toolhead combination require individual firmware.

** The configurations in this repository are for experimentation only. They
may result in mechanical or electrical damage to your equipment, or fire. Use
these configurations at your own risk, and use appropriate caution when
evaluating firmware. This software was not developed in affiliation with Aleph
Objects or Fargo Additive Manufacturing Equipment 3D, and they are in no way
responsible for damage caused as a result of using these configurations. ***
